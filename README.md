# Bank-Loan-Data-EDA

This Case Study deals with handling Raw data and Performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the data. We will be performing multiple Analysis such as Outlier Analysis, Univariant and Bivariant Analysis. This might be the first step for any Data Analyst or Data Scientist 


## Case Study Description

This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

**Data Understanding:**

-`application_data.csv` contains all the information of the client at the time of application.
The data is about wheather a client has payment difficulties.
-
`previous_application.csv` contains information about the client’s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.

-`columns_descrption.csv` is data dictionary which describes the meaning of the variables.
